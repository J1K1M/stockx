[Python practise to gather other data in other ways for my 'Dunks vs Air Jordan 1' analysis]
Trying to use requests, selenium and pandas to retrieve and create a database.
The database will contain two silhouettes, the Air Jordan 1 and Dunks, and all their designs and products inside StockX.
Information includes, name of the products, release date, retail price ++
It will be used in my analysis of comparing the two silhouettes and how the Dunks have come back as a popular sneaker.
