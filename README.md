# stockx
Trying to use requests, selenium and pandas to retrieve and create a database.
The database will contain two silhouettes, the Air Jordan 1 and Dunks, and all their designs and products inside StockX.
Information includes, name of the products, release date, retail price.
It will be used in my analysis of comparing the two silhouettes and how the Dunks have come back as a popular sneaker.
